# Flappy Bird Game using Pygame üê¶üéÆ

## Description
- This project is a simplified version of the classic game "Flappy Bird" implemented in Python using the Pygame library.
- The Flappy Bird game is a side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird by clicking the mouse to make it jump and navigate through obstacles (pipes).
- The goal is to survive as long as possible by avoiding obstacles and passing through gaps between pipes to earn points.

- **Player Control:** The player can make the bird jump by clicking the mouse.
- **Obstacles:** Pipes are randomly generated to create obstacles for the bird.
