# Pygame Flappy Bird

* The goal of this project is to create a simple clone of the popular mobile game "Flappy Bird" using the Pygame library, offering players a fun and challenging gaming experience.
  
* It sets up the Pygame environment, initializes Pygame, and configures the game window.

* The game includes a player character (a bird) that the player controls by clicking the mouse to make the bird jump.

* The game handles events such as clicking the mouse, and it updates the game state accordingly.

* The game includes graphical assets such as background images, bird images, and obstacle images.

* It uses Pygame to handle game loops, rendering graphics, and managing game logic.

* It also provides a game over screen with the option to restart the game.
