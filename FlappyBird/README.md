# Pygame Flappy Bird
* This code is a Python program that implements a simplified version of the classic game "Flappy Bird" using the Pygame library.

* It sets up the Pygame environment, initializes Pygame, and configures the game window.

* The game includes a player character (a bird) that the player controls by clicking the mouse to make the bird jump.

* There are obstacles in the form of pipes that the player must navigate through.

* The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases as the bird successfully passes through pipes.

* The player can restart the game if they lose by clicking a "Restart" button.

* The game handles events such as clicking the mouse, and it updates the game state accordingly.

* The game includes graphical assets such as background images, bird images, and obstacle images.

* It uses Pygame to handle game loops, rendering graphics, and managing game logic.

* This code creates a simple and interactive game where the player controls a bird, avoids obstacles, and tries to achieve the highest score possible. 
* It also provides a game over screen with the option to restart the game.
