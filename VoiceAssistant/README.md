# Voice Assistant Project - "Sara"  ðŸ¤– ðŸ‘©

## Overview
* Sara is a voice-based assistant developed in Python, designed to understand and execute voice commands for various tasks.
* It utilizes speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, web browsing, and API integration to provide assistance to users.
* Check out the demo video of the project [Click here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7135995069353918464/)

## Features
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken commands to text for interpretation.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Communicates responses audibly to the user.
- **Application Launching**: Opens specified applications based on user requests.
- **Web Browsing**: Navigates to requested websites (e.g., YouTube, LinkedIn, Google, etc.).
- **Note Taking**: Allows users to dictate notes that get saved as text files.
- **Information Retrieval**: Utilizes Wikipedia for fetching information on queries.
- **Date and Time Reporting**: Provides the current date and time upon request.
- **Entertainment**: Offers jokes and plays music or videos on YouTube.

## Setup and Usage
1. **Requirements**: Ensure the required Python libraries are installed (`speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, `wikipedia`, `pywhatkit`, etc.).
   
2. **Execution**: Run the `main()` function to start the voice assistant. Upon starting, it waits for a wake word ("Sara") to listen to commands.

3. **Commands**: Interact with Sara by speaking commands such as:
   - Asking about itself: "Who are you?"
   - Requesting information: "Tell me about [topic]."
   - Opening applications: "Open Chrome."
   - Taking notes: "Make a note of [your note]."
   - Seeking entertainment: "Tell me a joke" or "Play [song/video]."

## Future Improvements
1. **Enhanced AI Capabilities**: Improve natural language processing and context understanding.
2. **Expanded Functionality**: Integrate more applications, services, and information sources.
3. **User Personalization**: Implement user-specific profiles and preferences.
